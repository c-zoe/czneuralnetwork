Neural Network with Regularization and Decision Boundary Visualization
This repository contains Python code for training a two-layer neural network with regularization and visualizing decision boundaries. The neural network is implemented from scratch using NumPy, and the visualization is done using Matplotlib.

The code demonstrates the following functionalities:
Training a two-layer neural network with sigmoid activation function.
Incorporating L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
Visualizing decision boundaries for different combinations of input features.
Utilizing mini-batch gradient descent for efficient training.
